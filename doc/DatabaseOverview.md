# Database Overview

The databases are modeled. The models are available in the GitLab repository in the "neo4j-mdr-db" area under "model" [here](https://gitlab.com/Novo-Nordisk/nn-public/openstudybuilder/OpenStudyBuilder-Solution/-/tree/main/neo4j-mdr-db/model){target=_blank}.

The models are created using a yEd editor from yWorks, it is suggested to use this software to view the models (software available [here](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed){target=_blank} or live view [here](https://www.yworks.com/yed-live/){target=_blank}).
